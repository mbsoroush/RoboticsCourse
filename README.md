# Robotics Course

About this Repository ðŸ¤–


Welcome to my Robotics Course Repository! This repository contains the exercises, assignments, and projects I completed during my robotics course, with a focus on ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). The course explores key robotics concepts such as motion planning, sensor integration, autonomous navigation, and robot simulation.

Contents:

ðŸ“‚ Exercises: Hands-on tasks that strengthen foundational robotics skills like kinematics, path planning, and control systems.

ðŸ¤– Projects: Practical robotics projects that utilize ROS2 to simulate and control autonomous robots in various environments.

ðŸ§ª Simulations: Robot simulations in Gazebo and other tools to test navigation and perception systems.
